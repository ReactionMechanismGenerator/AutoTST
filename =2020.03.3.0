Looking for: ['rmg::rdkit']


Pinned packages:
  - python 3.7.*


Could not solve for environment specs
The following packages are incompatible
└─ rdkit   is uninstallable because there are no viable options
   ├─ rdkit [2015.03.1|2015.09.2] would require
   │  └─ python 2.7* , which conflicts with any installable versions previously reported;
   ├─ rdkit 2015.03.1 would require
   │  └─ python 3.4* , which conflicts with any installable versions previously reported;
   └─ rdkit 2020.03.3.0 would require
      └─ py-boost  , which does not exist (perhaps a missing channel).
